## v1.5.0 - 2019 - August PLANNED
- Fixed issues
    - [#264](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/264): `future::error()` interface is odd
    - [#260](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/260): set_exception() should be a const member.
    - [#248](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/248): Lifetime of receivers returned by operator|
    - [#243](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/243): Vector of move only type passed to continuation fails to compile.
    
- Enhancements
    - [#269](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/269): Extend the default_executor with high and low priority
    - [#262](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/262): `system_timer` interface is cumbersome. Now it accepts a 
      duration from now. The previously available interface with a time_point is marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## v1.4.1 - 2019 - February - 08
- Fixed Issues
    - [#234](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/234): version is incorrect in stlabConfig.cmake
    - [#229](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/229): SIGBUS in future destructor
    - [#220](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/220): make_ready_future for move-only types
    
## v1.4.0 - 2018 - December - 12
- Fixed Issues
    - [#208](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/208): g++8.2.0 compiling error
    - [#206](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/206): channels does not allow processes as lvalues, only as rvalue
    - [#204](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/204): when_all does not support move-only types
    - [#192](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/192): Issues with executor_t and when_all()
    - [#188](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/188): question: channels and slow processes

- Enhancements
    - [#212](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/212): Join of future with move only type is missing
    - [#199](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/199): add operator|() as continuable operator
    - It is now possible to create with channel<void>() a receiver<void> (not a pair<sender<void>, receiver<void>>)

- Library Changes
    - Now C++17 is required to use the channels (This change was necessary, because the code became really messy to dispatch between copyable, move-only and void types)

- Additional Comments
    - It is necessary to patch std::variant for the combination of clang version <= 7 and stdlibc++. For further details see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46506387/getstring-for-variants-fail-under-clang-but-not-g and ./travis/patches/patch_std_variant.sh. This is because the clang bug https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31852

   - [#107](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/107) : Some channel functions have problematic names
- Library Breaking Changes
   - Concurrency Library
       - The functionality of channel's `zip` has changed. Now it behaves comparable to the ranges TS zip. The previous functionality is replaced with `zip_with`.
       - The `merge` and `join` functions are now deprecated and are replaced with `merge_channel<unordered_t>`and `merge_channel<round_robin_t>`.

   - [#119](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/119) : blocking_get randomly does not return
- Library Additions
   - Concurrency Library
       - Adding usage of std::optional, std::variant or std::experimental::optional when compiling with C++17 mode. So the dependency to boost.optional is optional.
       - Adding co-routine support for futures. (Only for VS 2017 and clang 5.0)
       - Adding main_executor for Qt support

   - [#26](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/26) : channel TODO get process state under mutex?
   - [#18](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/18) : future TODO `get_try()`
- Library Additions
    - Concurrency library
        - [serial queue](stlab/concurrency/serial_queue.hpp)
        - [task](stlab/concurrency/task.hpp)
        - Added feature requests [#95](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/95) (flatten futures) and [#38](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/38) (reduction on `future<void>`). Reduction of futures is now supported. So a `future<future<T>>` is reduced to `future<T>`. Currently
this is restricted to copyable types `T`.
    - [copy on write](stlab/copy_on_write.hpp)
    - [scope](stlab/scope.hpp)
    - [Test library](stlab/test/model.hpp)

    - CMake overhaul
    - Extended Travis CI support
    - AppVeyor support
- Breaking Changes
    - With [Issue #85](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/issues/85) the interface of `make_ready_future` and 
`make_exceptional_future` now require an executor as a second parameter.

## v1.0 - 10 June 2017

- Added the concurrency library:
    - futures
    - executors
    - channels
